# TODO: Fix Microphone Code Issues

- [x] Add Hamming window to FFT input to reduce spectral leakage
- [ ] Implement parabolic interpolation for accurate peak frequency detection
- [ ] Make frequency and magnitude thresholds configurable
- [ ] Improve sampling timing accuracy using a timer instead of tight_loop_contents
- [ ] Add noise floor consideration to detection logic
- [ ] Compile the code to ensure no errors
- [ ] Test microphone functionality
